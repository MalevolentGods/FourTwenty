# CHANGELOG

2.0.0
-----

### Features
- [Kerberos] - Reintroducing the solar dryer which can be used for drying multiple weed buds at once. (I'm planning to make this a multi-functional dryer)
- [Kerberos] - Added a recipe for weed seeds to the recipe book with a correct thumbnail
- [Kerberos] - Removed the ability to cook fresh weed buds in the crockpot (dry them on the rack or in a solar dryer)
- [Kerberos] - Updated fresh weed buds so that they can be dried on a normal drying rack one at a time
- [Kerberos] - Adjusted weed seed nutritional values to decrease hunger at the expense of sanity
- [Kerberos] - Added additional speech possibilities when smoking

### Fixes
- [Kerberos] - Fixed a bug with the weed bud thumbnails when viewing recipes


1.9.7
-----
- [Kerberos] - Fixed the infinite weed bug. Weed trees are now barren when they are spawned from seed and will have to grow the weed flower.
- [Kerberos] - Disabled weed seeds entirely because the aforementioned fix didn't really work. just affected the image.
- [Kerberos] - Cooking weed buds now gives you dried weed instead of weed seeds
- [Kerberos] - Disabled the dryer until I figure out how to make it compatible with the better crockpot mod
- [Kerberos] - Fixed a bug that was preventing the state of the weed trees (picked vs unpicked) to be saved on exit 
- [Kerberos] - Lowered the spawn rates of the weed trees

1.9.8
-----
- [Kerberos] - Cleaned up the code a little and clarified the comments as best as I could after more than a year away from the project

1.9.7
-----
- [Kerberos] - Fixed bug causing game to crash when digging up the weed plant stump
