# Four Twenty
## - A Don't Starve Together Mod


## Description
Finally, a reason to survive in the wilderness! Thanks to Malevolent Gods, your favorite smokeable herb can now be found 
growing in the wilderness. Buds can be harvested and then smoked out of a pipe or hand-rolled into a spliff. 
Smoking gives you a small/medium boost to your sanity but comes with a hunger debuff that lasts half a day. 
The munchies are extra brutal when you're trying to live off the land. Luckily, there are no cops to worry about! 

## Features
- New harvestable tree with custom artwork and animation (spawn regions and rate configurable in the mod config) 
- Smokeable herb with custom artwork and effects 
- Wooden Pipe with custom artwork (courtesy of Wight's Pipe mod for the original Don't Starve ;) 
- Hand-Rolled Joint with custom artwork 
- Trees can be replanted using seeds from harvested herb. Four fresh buds can be combined to create a seed.
- The Solar Dryer is a whole new technology with custom actions. It can be used to turn fresh bud into dried bud. 
  When enabled, dried bud is a requirement to roll a joint and also removes the perishable attribute. 

## Planned Features
- The Solar Dryer will be able to dry anything that can be dried on the drying rack
- Fresh weed buds will be able to be used in cooking recipes as a vegetable

## Known Issues
- Animations for weed on the drying rack is wonky
