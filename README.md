Finally, a reason to survive in the wilderness! Thanks to Malevolent Gods, your favorite smokeable herb can now be found growing in the wilderness. Buds can be harvested and then smoked out of a pipe or hand-rolled into a spliff. Smoking gives you a small/medium boost to your sanity but comes with a hunger debuff that lasts half a day. The munchies are extra brutal when you're trying to live off the land. Luckily, there are no cops to worry about!

Features 

- New harvestable tree with custom artwork and animation (spawn regions and rate configurable in the mod config) 
- Smokeable herb with custom artwork and effects 
- Wooden Pipe with custom artwork (courtesy of Wight's Pipe mod for the original Don't Starve ;) 
- Hand-Rolled Joint with custom artwork 



Beta Features (must be turned on individually using the mod config) 

- Trees can be replanted using seeds from harvested herb. For now, fresh bud will return seeds when cooked over the fire. 
- The Solar Dryer is a whole new technology with custom actions. It can be used to turn fresh bud into dried bud. When enabled, dried bud is a requirement to roll a joint and also removes the perishable attribute. 



Planned Features 

- The Solar Dryer will also be able to dry vegetables, returning an item similar to jerky. This should make farming and food storage more efficient. 
- The seeds will be created in a different way - either feeding to a bird or something having to do with the drying process. Maybe even add an action grind the bud, which would have a random chance of returning seeds.
