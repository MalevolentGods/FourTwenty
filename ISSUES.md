1. Smarter crockpot mod can cause crashes

2. Pipe randomly disappears from the inventory

3. Trees do not spawn as expected

4. Needs balance


- Minor -
1. Dried buds can be placed back in the Solar Dryer after they've been removed. Solar Dryer will still only activate when filled with fresh buds, so the bug is mostly harmless. 

2. The joint isn't oriented correctly during the smoking animation. Has something to do with the symbol I'm swapping. 

3. None of the custom idle animations have a shadow. Just a matter of laziness really. 

4. Animation bug at trunk base when tree falls
