--This script defines the tokeable component action, which is the guts of the TOKE action that we created in the modmain file.
--This is all still a work in progress as I try to figure shit out. A lot of it is based on the "playable" action used by instruments since that's what the pipe animation is based off of. 
--Long story short: some of this can be removed and more will be added when the joint gets created.
